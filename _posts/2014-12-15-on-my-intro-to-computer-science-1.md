_It seems fitting that my first post should be about my first experience with computer science, so here goes:_

Back in the good old days of high school, a whopping five years ago, my primary objective was to maximize my number of AP courses and exams taken. (Whether or not this was the optimal use of my time and energy, what this mindset says about me or the state of our education system, etc. is a whole other topic and discussion for another time.)

Anyway, at the end of my AP Calculus BC class junior year, I heard that our Computer Science department had launched a pilot program to get more students to take programming, by allowing students who had performed well in AP Calculus to skip the honors-level Programming 1 class and jump into AP Programming. (The class was called AP Programming at my school, although it corresponds to CollegeBoard's AP Computer Science (A) course. By the way, this was in 2009-2010, either the last year that AP Computer Science AB was offered or the first year that it was no longer offered.)

AP class? Okay, sign me up! I don't remember the details, but I think I had already enrolled in AP Statistics or Psychology or maybe U.S. History for senior year. However, programming sounded more *novel* - like many other students learning it for the first time, I had little idea what it was about, but perhaps it was precisely that which intrigued me. Both my calculus teacher and the programming teacher encouraged me to try it out, as did several friends who had taken it, and I think my father (who works in technology) also remarked it would probably be a more practically useful class than one in the social sciences. After a short deliberation, I figured, why not, and signed up for the class!

Since AP exams were over by this point, I spent a couple of days a week in the computer science classroom during my free AP Calculus period, to start learning the material from the Programming 1 class I was skipping. I won't lie - the beginning was pretty rough for me. The only line of the canonical Hello World program in Java that even remotely made sense was, of course, 

{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
{% endhighlight %}

It actually wasn't until two years later that all the boilerplate code made complete sense to me. (This is because I didn't take another class using Java until two years later, not because it took me two years to wrap my head around classes and methods. More details in a later post!)

Frankly, that general idea probably describes most of AP Programming in senior year fairly well: learning how to write code and knowing what it did at a high level, without fully understanding how or why exactly it worked. Given that I was juggling other AP classes, college applications, and several extracurriculars at the time, I settled for the fact that I was passing my tests (as in, written quizzes; I did not know about unit tests at the time). But as a naturally curious person, I was constantly telling myself I would sit down one weekend when I had more time, and do practice problems or read a textbook until everything *really* clicked. Perhaps not surprisingly, this never really happened, between homework and exams and extracurriculars and minimum viable number of hours of sleep and social activity...

And then it was May 4, 2010, AP Computer Science exam date.
